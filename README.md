System Analysis and Design
## Project Reflection – DriverPass System Design

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?  
The client for this project was DriverPass, a company that provides training and resources to help students pass their driving tests. They wanted a secure, reliable, and scalable **web-based system** that could be accessed from both desktop and mobile devices. The system needed to support services such as scheduling driving lessons, tracking student progress, managing user accounts, and securely storing testing information. It also required role-based access for different types of users, including students, secretaries, and administrators.

### What did you do particularly well?  
I did particularly well in identifying and clearly defining the technical requirements of the system. I explained how hosting the application on cloud infrastructure would allow for scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance. I also addressed the importance of security by specifying encryption, authentication, and role-based access controls. My documentation connected these requirements directly to the client’s needs, ensuring that the design was both practical and future-ready.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  
If I could revise one part, I would improve the UML diagrams by adding more detail to the sequence diagram and activity diagrams. Expanding these diagrams with more real-world examples of user interactions would make the workflows easier to follow and give a clearer picture of how the system responds under different conditions. This would strengthen the connection between the requirements and the visual design.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on security, convenience, and accessibility. Students needed a platform they could access from anywhere, while staff needed reliable tools to schedule, manage, and monitor progress. These needs guided decisions such as building responsive front-end designs, implementing role-based access controls, and ensuring concurrency in database transactions. Considering user needs is critical because software must solve the real problems users face—ignoring them would result in a system that is difficult to use, unreliable, or insecure.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?  
My approach to designing software combines **requirements analysis, UML modeling, and architectural planning**. I start by breaking down business and technical requirements, then map them into diagrams and design models. I also evaluate hosting platforms, frameworks, and security practices early in the process to ensure scalability and reliability. In the future, I would continue to use this structured approach but add more iterative prototyping and user feedback sessions to validate the design before implementation. This ensures that the final system is both technically sound and user-centered.
